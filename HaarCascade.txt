HAAR CASCADE ALGORITHM

Haar Features (aka rudimentary building blocks)
5 features:
a)2 edge features
b)2 line features
c)1 four-rectangle features

Each of them check the relations of pixels in those segments and then when we chain them together and layer 
enough, we can get a template for a face. It learns what combination of them is required to make a face.
That's why it's enough to use a grayscale becuase we only check for brightness.
